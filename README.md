Web Development Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning web development, from understanding how the internet works to building websites and using Git for version control. Each task builds on the previous one, helping me strengthen my technical and problem-solving skills as I grow as a developer.

Task 1 — Git, GitHub, and Web Basics

In Task 1, I created my first GitHub repository, practiced essential Git commands, and wrote notes on web concepts such as the Internet, DNS, domain names, browsers, and HTTP. I also learned how to use .gitignore to hide specific files and manage my project more efficiently.

Task 2 — Front-End Beginner Project

In Task 2, I began hands-on front-end development by completing the first beginner project from Roadmap.sh
. Using only HTML and CSS, I built a simple webpage and pushed it to my GitHub repository through the terminal with Git commands. This task helped me apply my basic web-design knowledge while practicing Git workflow for real projects.
