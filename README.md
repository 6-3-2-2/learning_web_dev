Web Development Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning web development â€” from understanding how the internet works to building websites and using Git for version control. Each task builds on the previous one, helping me strengthen my technical and problem-solving skills as I grow as a developer.

ðŸ§© Task 1 â€” Git, GitHub, and Web Basics

In Task 1, I created my first GitHub repository, practiced essential Git commands, and wrote notes on web concepts such as the Internet, DNS, domain names, browsers, and HTTP. I also learned how to use .gitignore to hide specific files and manage my project more efficiently.

ðŸ§© Task 2 â€” Front-End Beginner Project

In Task 2, I began hands-on front-end development by completing the first beginner project from Roadmap.sh
. Using only HTML and CSS, I built a simple webpage and pushed it to my GitHub repository through the terminal with Git commands. This task helped me apply my basic web-design knowledge while practicing Git workflow for real projects.

ðŸ§© Task 3 â€” Single Page Website (F1 Drivers)

In Task 3, I created a single-page website displaying profiles of Formula 1 drivers. Each driverâ€™s profile includes their photo, name, team, and a short detail about them. The website was built using HTML and CSS. This task helped me strengthen my front-end design skills, practice structuring and styling web pages, and improve my use of Git for version control through multiple commits and updates.

ðŸ§© Task 4 â€” Movie Reflection: The Social Network

For Task 4, I watched The Social Network, a film that portrays the creation and rise of Facebook. The movie highlights themes of innovation, ambition, betrayal, and the challenges that come with building something revolutionary. From a programmerâ€™s perspective, it provided insight into teamwork, problem-solving, and the ethical decisions faced during tech development. This task encouraged me to reflect on the balance between creativity, collaboration, and integrity in the world of technology.
